**Goal:**
This program is designed to traverse directories. When it encounters any CSV files, it will parse and consolidate the data into a single CSV file.

**How to Run:**
The program will prompt you to input the path containing the data. After you provide the data path, it will execute and display the paths of the resulting CSV file and log file in the console.
The output folder is already created in the GIT repository. Hence, we don't need to input any output or log file explicitly

**Incomplete Data criteria:**
I have used a null check to find the incomplete data.
